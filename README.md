# settingupmacforml

I bought a new Mac. I need to install everything that is necessary to build the machine learning project in my local machine. I could have copied everything from my old Mac using Time Machine. But I wanted to start from the scratch so that I can document the steps and I can share with all of those who daily job is not coding but who wants to get hands dirty every now and then.

I am not a developer. I am a product manager. I don’t code in a daily basis. But it’s fun to write some code when necessary. At least, I am able to clone the project locally in my machine. 

1. Install python
		 Check whether there is python installed by default. Mac comes with default python version 2.7.0. I will use anaconda that python and different packages for data science and machine learning.

2. Install miniconda 
 I chose miniconda because I don’t need all the packages right away. I can install those packages in the virtual environments I create on the need basis. I like to isolate dependent packages for different types.

3. Managing environments

4. Install Jupyter notebook
